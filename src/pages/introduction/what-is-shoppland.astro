  <h2 id="history">History</h2>
  <p>
    Shoppland was founded in 2023 by a team of e-commerce enthusiasts and technology innovators who recognized 
    the need for a more user-centric online marketplace. The founding team sought to address common pain points 
    in existing e-commerce platforms, such as complex navigation, unreliable vendor quality, and cumbersome 
    checkout processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beta version of Shoppland launched in June 2023, initially focusing on electronics and home goods. 
    After gathering user feedback and refining the platform, Shoppland officially launched to the public in 
    September 2023, expanding to include fashion, beauty, and specialty goods categories.

    Since its launch, Shoppland has experienced rapid growth, attracting both independent sellers and established 
    brands to its marketplace. The platform continues to evolve with regular updates and new features based on 
    user feedback and market trends.
